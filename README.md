Linus Kernel Statistics
----------------------
This repository has statistical study about linux Kernel which includes several linux-kernel stats.


## Introduction
Software evolution is essential and indispensable for a software system, "else it will become progressively less satisfactory." The software evolution can be characterized using various parameters such as version number, lines of code, number of patches, and other software matrices.

Linux has an interesting history and is arguably the most popular open-source operating system. In the early days of computing, programmers developed on the bare hardware in the hardware's language. The lack of an operating system meant that only one application (and one user) could use the large and expensive device at a time. Early operating systems were developed in the 1950s to provide a simpler development experience. Examples include the General Motors Operating System (GMOS) developed for the IBM 701 and the FORTRAN Monitor System (FMS) developed by North American Aviation for the IBM 709.

In the 1960s, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a host of companies developed an experimental operating system called Multics (or Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) for the GE-645. One of the developers of this operating system, AT&T, dropped out of Multics and developed their operating system in 1970 called Unics. Along with this operating system was the C language, for which C was developed and then rewritten to make operating system development portable.

Twenty years later, Andrew Tanenbaum created a microkernel version of UNIXÂ®, called MINIX (for minimal UNIX), that ran on small personal computers. This open-source operating system inspired Linus Torvalds' initial development of Linux in the early 1990s. Linux is still evolving.

We have conducted a thorough review of the evolution of the Kernel from 17 Sept 1991 to the present in this post and attached the results obtained.

## Technology Stack
The Linux Kernel Stats repository has been developed using a combination of bash and python scripts. The bash scripts are used for data collection, while the python scripts are used for data processing. The development environment used for the repo was Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.


The following tools were used in the development of this repository:

- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Bash was used for its simplicity and ease of use in collecting system information, while Python 3.10.10 was used for data processing and web scraping.

Git was used for version control and collaborative development. All code changes were tracked using Git, and changes were made using the standard Git workflow of branching, committing, and merging.

Some of the scripts in the repository also use various Linux command-line tools such as grep, awk, and curl for data extraction, processing and analysis.

The Linux Kernel Stats repository was developed on a Linux-based operating system. It is recommended to run the scripts on a Linux-based system to ensure full compatibility and accurate results.

## How to run the scripts   
#### Clone / Download
##### Step 1
[A] To clone the Linux Kernel Stable Tree, make a folder named "linux-stable" in the home location : home/usernameclone the repo in the folder "linux-stable" using ``` https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git ```. This will download the current kernel source repository.

[B] Additionaly, you will need to clone the following in the home directory: 
   * ``` git clone https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/xiang/erofs-utils.git ```
   * ``` git clone https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/legion/kbd.git ```
   * ``` git clone https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git ```
   * ``` git clone https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/nico/archive ```


##### Step 2
Now, clone the repository that contains the scripts using : ``` git clone https://github.com/tapaswenipathak/linux-kernel-stats ```

Install the following dependencies before proceeding to execute the python scripts:
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) 
- [bs4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup)
- [lxml](https://lxml.de/installation.html) 


#### Run files separately using commands 
First, your script must declare which interpreter to use. You do this in the first line of the file. If it's a shell script, it should be #!/bin/sh or #!/bin/bash.

Here's an example for how to run a script:
This is a script that writes your username: ``` echo-whoami.sh ```
- To make it executable, use:
``` chmod a+x echo-whoami.sh ```
- Then you can run it using:
``` ./echo-whoami.sh ``` or ```bash echo-whoami.sh```

So, you can run individual script files like this: 
- ``` bash loc.sh ```
- ``` bash glimpseindex_cocci.sh ```
- ``` bash patches.sh ```

#### Run using Makefile
Make sure to have `make` installed in your device. If not, then install it using `sudo apt install make`. 
Now, go to the directory which contains the Makefile and type the command `make` and execute it. This will run all the code mentioned in `all:` which is mentioned in the Makefile.

## Interpreting Guide
This guide is intended to provide an understanding of how to interpret the data obtained from the linux-kernel-stats project.

The project collects data about the Linux kernel releases and provides various statistics, including list of drivers, list of release notes, and author contributions.

### Data Directory
The Data directory contains all the data generated by the linux-kernel-stats project. It contains data regarding number of commits, number of lines of code changed and removed, drivers used, information related to drivers etc.

The data is organized into various files and folders, including list of drivers and shortlogs of various drivers. Each file contains information regarding the specific Linux kernel release, including commit counts and author contributions.

### Interpreting data

### Discrepancies and Irregularities
There may be discrepancies and irregularities in the data collected by the linux-kernel-stats project. These may occur due to various reasons, such as incomplete data collection or inaccuracies in the data.

It is important to keep in mind that the data collected by the linux-kernel-stats project is based on the publicly available data.

Note on data source from (kbd and erofs-utils):
> The source repository used (kbd and erof-utils) for the linux kernel versions were not the official ones. As a result, we were unable to obtain results for some versions in those sources, using the scripts provided in this repository. We are currently working on updating the scripts to work with the official repository, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

### Usage:
To run the scripts, navigate to the root directory of the repository and execute the `make` command.
This command will run all of the scripts and generate the data files in the data directory. Refer to [How to run the scripts](#how-to-run-the-scripts) for more details.

### Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the linux-kernel-stats project, please refer to the [Contributing Guide](#contributing-guide) for guidelines on how to contribute.

### Tools Used
The linux-kernel-stats project is developed using various tools and technologies, including Bash, Python, and Git. The data is collected using scripts that are run periodically to collect data on the Linux kernel releases. See [Technology Stack](#technology-stack).
