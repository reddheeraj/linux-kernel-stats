    Fix dma-api-checking warnings in Sun HME
    dma-api debug code to check if a driver has released all dma allocations
    This patch adds the dma-api/driver_filter file to debugfs. The root user
    can write a driver name into this file to see only dma-api errors for
    dma-api implementation has no internal state which needs to be destroyed with
    Merge branch 'dma-api/debug' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/joro/linux-2.6-iommu into core/iommu
    (most have been due to the dma-api debug patchset.))
    Mapping the destination multiple times is a misuse of the dma-api.
