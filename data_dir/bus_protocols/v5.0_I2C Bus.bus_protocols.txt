    The Renesas RZ/A and RZ/G2L I2C Bus Interface has no less than 8
    interrupts.  Hence document the "interrupt-names" property, to make it
    easier to review the interrupt mappings in DTS files.
    
    Note that this property cannot be made required yet, as the RIIC nodes
    in all DTS files lack the property.

    drm/radeon: Don't destroy I2C Bus Rec in radeon_ext_tmds_enc_destroy().
    
    commit 082918471139b07964967cfe5f70230909c82ae1 upstream.
    
    radeon_i2c_fini() walks thru the list of I2C bus recs rdev->i2c_bus[]
    to destroy each of them.
    radeon_ext_tmds_enc_destroy() however also has code to destroy it's
    associated I2C bus rec which has been obtained by radeon_i2c_lookup()
    and is therefore also in the i2c_bus[] list.
    This causes a double free resulting in a kernel panic when unloading
    the radeon driver.
    Removing destroy code from radeon_ext_tmds_enc_destroy() fixes this
    problem.

    char/tpm: Add new driver for Infineon I2C TIS TPM
    
    This patch adds a driver to support Infineon's SLB 9635 TT 1.2 Soft I2C TPMs
    which follow the TGC TIS 1.2 TPM specification[1] and Infineon's I2C Protocol
    Stack Specification 0.20.
    The I2C Protocol Stack Specification is a simple adaption of the LPC TIS
    Protocol to the I2C Bus.
    The I2C TPMs can be used when LPC Bus is not available (i.e. non x86
    architectures like ARM).
    
    The driver is based on the tpm_tis.c driver by Leendert van Dorn and Kyleen
    Hall and has quite similar functionality.
    
    Tested on Nvidia ARM Tegra2 Development Platform and Beagleboard (ARM OMAP)
    Tested with the Trousers[2] TSS API Testsuite v 0.3 [3]
    Compile-tested on x86 (32/64-bit)
    
    Updates since version 2.1.4:
    - included "Lock the I2C adapter for a sequence of requests", by Bryan Freed
    - use __i2c_transfer instead of own implementation of unlocked i2c_transfer
    - use struct dev_pm_ops for power management via SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS
    
    Updates since version 2.1.3:
    - use proper probing mechanism
    * either add the tpm using I2C_BOARD_INFO to your board file or probe it
    * during runtime e.g on BeagleBoard using :
    * "echo tpm_i2c_infineon 0x20 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-2/new_device"
    - fix possible endless loop if hardware misbehaves
    - improved return codes
    - consistent spelling i2c/tpm -> I2C/TPM
    - remove hardcoded sleep values and msleep usage
    - removed debug statements
    - added check for I2C functionality
    - renaming to tpm_i2c_infineon
    
    Updates since version 2.1.2:
    - added sysfs entries for duration and timeouts
    - updated to new tpm_do_selftest
    
    Updates since version 2.1.0:
    - improved error handling
    - implemented workarounds needed by the tpm
    - fixed typos

    V4L/DVB (3689): Kconfig: fix VP-3054 Secondary I2C Bus build configuration menu dependencies
    
    This patch fixes a dependency problem that affected the indentation order
    within the individual frontend selection support menus for cx88-dvb.
    - created a boolean dependency link for VIDEO_CX88_VP3054, so that
      it's tristate value will be the same as that of VIDEO_CX88_DVB.
    - VIDEO_CX88_VP3054 is automatically selected by VIDEO_CX88_DVB_ALL_FRONTENDS,
      but is otherwise selected by VIDEO_CX88_DVB_VP3054, offered as an option
      under VIDEO_CX88_DVB_MT352
