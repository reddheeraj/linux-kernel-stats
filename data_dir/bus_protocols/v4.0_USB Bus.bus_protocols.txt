    ARM64: dts: meson-gxbb: Add USB Hub GPIO hog
    
    The ODroid-C2 on-board USB Hub needs to to have it's reset signal set to
    high level in order to be enumerated by the USB Host Controller.
    
    But this management must be part of the currently in-development Generic
    Power Sequence patch that will allow a USB Controller driver to start and stop
    a power sequence associated to the USB Bus.
    
    In the meantime, a simple USB Hog will work to enable the USB Hub.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: purge dwc3_stop_active_transfers()
    
    That function is unnecessarily called from
    dwc3_gadget_reset_interrupt(). Gadget drivers (and
    thus, functions) are required to dequeue all pending
    requests when they get notified about a USB Bus
    Reset.
    
    Trying to make sure there are no pending requests
    only serves the purpose of working around possibly
    bad gadgets.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: move AcceptU1Ena and AcceptU2Ena to Reset IRQ
    
    According to the databook, the DWC3 Core will
    reset those bits to 0 on USB Bus Reset. This
    means we must re-enable those bits on every
    reset interrupt.
    
    Because we will always get a Reset interrupt
    after loading a gadget driver, we can, instead
    of re-enabling something that was just lost,
    move the handling of those bits to the Reset
    Interrupt.
    
    This patch fixes USB30CV U1/U2 Test.
