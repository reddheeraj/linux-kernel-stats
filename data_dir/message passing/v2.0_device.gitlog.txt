    Don't open console on --bkeymap
    
    Check that -b hasn't specified, similarly to -m, before loadkeys tries to open
    the console. As for --mktable, --bkeymap doesn't need it. This allows to dump
    binary keymaps in a larger range of situations where ownership of the console
    device is not guarranteed e.g., when running from an Xterm.
