**[General Statistics]{.underline}**

We have documented a total of 47 scripts that cover a wide range of
topics related to the Linux operating system. These scripts which are
designed to perform various tasks are related to resource management,
memory, storage, sound, polling, power handling, firmware, bus
protocols, and more.

To ensure that the information provided is accurate and reliable, we
have thoroughly read all the references and documentation related to
these scripts. This involved studying the source code, reading the main
pages, consulting the Linux kernel documentation, and reviewing relevant
articles.

Through our research, we have gained a comprehensive understanding of
the various aspects of the Linux kernel that these scripts cover.

This project provides a valuable resource for anyone looking to gain a
deeper understanding of the Linux operating system and its various
components. By studying these scripts and the underlying concepts they
represent, readers can gain insights into how the Linux kernel works,
it's various specifications and drivers, and how it can be optimized and
customized to meet specific needs and requirements.

The Linux Kernel Stats repository on GitHub is a collection of scripts
and tools that provide statistical information about the Linux kernel\'s
development over time. These tools are designed to extract information
from the Git repositories of various versions of the Linux kernel and
generate reports and statistical analysis.

Some of the general statistics of the Linux Kernel Stats repository
include:

No. of Commits: One of the scripts gives the no. of commits for each
version as output.

No. of Patches: The repository contains data for more than 750,000
patches that have been applied to the Linux kernel since its inception.

No. of Lines: The scripts in the repository are capable of generating
reports on the number of lines of code added, modified, and deleted in
each version of the Linux kernel.

Git Logs Obtained by the Scripts: Many of the scripts in the repository
are designed to obtain Git logs from various parts of the Linux kernel,
such as drivers, firmware, and subsystems. These logs can provide
insight into the development history of these components and the changes
that have been made over time.

The repository contains a wide range of scripts that generate different
types of statistics and reports. For example, some scripts generate
reports on the number of lines of code in each version of the Linux
kernel, while others provide information on the number of directories or
files in each version.

Overall, the Linux Kernel Stats repository provides a wealth of
information about the development history of the Linux kernel. The data
and reports generated by the scripts can be used to track changes over
time, identify trends and patterns, and gain insights into the evolution
of the operating system.

The following are important categories:

1.  **Process Management**

> Process management is a fundamental part of the operating system. It
> is one of the most critical tasks of an operating system. It involves
> creating, scheduling, executing, and terminating processes, and
> ensuring that they run correctly and efficiently. The
> \"message_passing.sh\" script extracts information about the
> message-passing mechanisms used in the Linux kernel, such as pipes,
> signals, sockets, and more. Message passing is a communication
> paradigm that allows processes to exchange data by sending messages to
> each other. It can be useful for developers and researchers interested
> in understanding how different processes communicate with each other
> in the Linux operating system.

2.  **Process Synchronization**

> Process synchronization is crucial for ensuring the correct execution
> order of processes and threads and preventing race conditions. It
> ensures that different threads do not interfere with each other\'s
> execution. The \"spinlock.sh\" script extracts information about the
> spinlock mechanisms used in the Linux kernel, such as raw spinlocks,
> queued spinlocks, and more. Spinlocks are synchronization primitives
> that allow only one thread to access a critical section of code at a
> time. The \"spinlock_log.sh\" script provides a log of the same
> information. It can be useful for developers and researchers
> interested in understanding how spinlocks work and how to use them in
> their own code.

3.  **Memory Management**

> Memory management is an essential aspect of the operating system that
> deals with the allocation, deallocation, and management of memory
> resources. One of the scripts named \"buffer.sh\" extracts information
> about buffer management in the Linux kernel. Buffers are used to store
> data temporarily, and their efficient management is critical for the
> performance of the system. The script uses gitlog to retrieve
> information about the implementation and usage of buffers in the
> kernel and grep to filter the results.

4.  **I/O systems**

> Input/output (I/O) systems are responsible for communicating with
> various peripherals such as disks, keyboards, printers, etc. The
> scripts in this category extract information and statistics about the
> different drivers in the Linux kernel. For instance, the
> \"bluetooth.sh\" script retrieves information about the Bluetooth
> driver, while \"sound.sh\" script provides details about the sound
> driver and the \"bus_protocols.sh\" script provides information about
> the different bus protocols used in the Linux kernel, such as USB,
> PCI, and more.

5.  **File System Interface**

> The file system interface is a critical component of any operating
> system, as it is responsible for managing files and directories. In
> the Linux operating system, the file system interface provides a
> unified way of accessing and manipulating files, regardless of the
> underlying file system. The \"files.sh\" script provides information
> about the all the files used in the Linux kernel, such as regular
> files, directories, symbolic links, and device files.
>
> The Linux file system interface supports many advanced features, such
> as file permissions, file ownership, file locking, and file system
> quotas. These features allow users and applications to control access
> to files and ensure that the system remains secure and stable. The
> file system interface also provides a way for applications to read and
> write files using standard system calls, such as open(), read(), and
> write().
>
> In addition to the standard file system interface, Linux also supports
> many specialized file systems, such as the procfs, sysfs, and tmpfs
> file systems. These file systems provide a way for the operating
> system to expose system information and configuration settings to
> applications and users.

6.  **The Linux System**

> The Linux system is a complex operating system with many subsystems
> and components. The scripts in this category provide information and
> statistics about various aspects of the Linux operating system,
> including versioning, hardware tracing, patch management, resource
> manipulation, power handling, release dates, and more. For instance,
> the \"loc.sh\" script counts the number of lines of code in the
> kernel, while \"patches.sh\" script retrieves information about the
> patches applied to the kernel. The \"polling_git_log.sh\" script
> provides information about the different polling mechanisms used in
> the Linux kernel, while the \"romtypes.sh\" script provides
> information about the romtype driver in Linux Kernel. The scripts use
> gitlog and grep to retrieve and filter the required information from
> the kernel repositories. These scripts can be useful for developers,
> researchers, and anyone interested in understanding the inner workings
> of the Linux operating system.

kernel versions.

[Logic]{.underline}: This script generates the number of lines of code
of subsystems present in each version of the Linux kernel. It loops
through all the versions of the Linux kernel and uses find and awk
commands to count the number of lines of code of each subsystem.

[Ideal Output]{.underline}: A list of the number of lines of code of
subsystems present in each version of the Linux kernel.

**versions_till_now.sh**:

[Input]{.underline}: Uses git repositories which contain various linux
kernel versions.

[Logic]{.underline}: This script generates a list of all versions until
the time of executing the script. It loops through each repository of
linux kernel and uses git tag command to list all the versions of the
Linux kernel until the current time.

[Ideal Output]{.underline}: A list of all versions of the Linux kernel
